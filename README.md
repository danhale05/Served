Serving my static page using node.js. 

Setup to run locally on port 3000 (localhost:3000).

You would need to run `npm install` from the command line, in the root folder and then use `node server.js` to spin up the server. I'd recommend installing Nodemon - `npm install nodemon` so that you use 
`nodemon server.js` in place of `node server.js`

Nodemon enables you to keep a server running and will update your changes without needing to restart the server each time.

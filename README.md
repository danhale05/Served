Serving my static page content using Node.Js. 

It's current setting is to run locally on port 3000, `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the root folder, you would need to first run `npm install` from the command line, then use `node server.js` to spin up the server. I'd recommend installing Nodemon - `npm install nodemon` so then you would use `nodemon server.js` in place of `node server.js`.

Nodemon enables you to keep a server running and will update your changes without needing to restart the server each time.

I just included everything for my MyNinja.co 1.0 site along with everything. Enjoy!
